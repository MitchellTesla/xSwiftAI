# NeuralNet - SwiftAI
This is the NeuralNet module for the Swift AI project. Full details on the project can be found in the [main repo](https://github.com/Swift-AI/Swift-AI). This is an experimental project extension of the master/main repository. 

The `NeuralNet` class contains a fully connected, feed-forward artificial neural network. This neural net offers support for deep learning, and is designed for flexibility and use in performance-critical applications.
